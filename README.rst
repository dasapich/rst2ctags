rst2ctags
=========

This application generates ctags-compatible output for the sections of a
reStructuredText document.  It does *not* use the docutils engine since docutils
is far too slow for my needs.

The motivation was to have a tool fast enough to use with the `TagBar
<https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar>`_ plugin in Vim.
